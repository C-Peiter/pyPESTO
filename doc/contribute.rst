Contribute tests
----------------

Tests are located in the ``test`` folder. All files starting with ``test_``
contain tests and are automatically run on Travis CI. To run them manually,
type::

    python3 -m pytest test

You can also run specific tests.

Tests can be written with `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_
or the `unittest <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>`_ module.
